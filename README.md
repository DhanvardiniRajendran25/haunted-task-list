# 🎃 Haunted Task List  
*A tiny Halloween-themed productivity app built for the Kiroween Hackathon.*

Haunted Task List is a minimal React + Vite web app where tasks become “haunted” if you leave them unfinished for more than 10 seconds. It demonstrates how Kiro’s AI-powered development features (vibe coding, specs, and steering) can rapidly scaffold and refine simple applications.
